Nessus Vulnerability Scanning Project

In this project, I configured and managed Nessus, a popular vulnerability scanning tool, to perform regular security assessments across different systems. The project involved tasks such as setting up scan configurations, managing vulnerability databases, and automating email notifications upon scan completion. I also explored offline update strategies for Nessus when disconnected from the internet and worked on generating PDF reports for scan results. Additionally, I configured Nessus to email scan results to specific recipients and ensured proper system integration for continuous security monitoring.

This project was a component of my Linux System Administration course.
